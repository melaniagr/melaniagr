**Computational Cognitive Science PhD Candidate Preparation**

---

Hi all, I started learning about Innovation in Healthcare thinking that many systems can be improved. At first, I grabbed different materials such as online courses in Innovation in Healthcare, ranging from What is innovation? to Health Technology assessment and Data Ethics. In parallel, I developed research and clinical skills through audit and quality improvement work.

After this process, I felt the need to go deeper, seeking technical expertise. Hence I continued with Stanford’s University Fundamentals of Machine Learning for Healthcare and Evaluations of AI Applications in Healthcare. By this point I was convinced I wanted to pursuit further training and developed a strategy to level up my skills.

When asking myself in which specific area, it was clear I wanted to continue in the Cognitive Sciences, since I have always been fascinated by the mind – and consequently worked or shadowed consultants in Neurosurgery, Neurology and Psychiatry departments. When asking myself from which angle I wanted to study the mind, I knew I wanted it to be from the computational side – a field I wanted to immerse myself since I had my first encounter with the course “Synapses, neurons and brains” by Idan Segev. I was fascinated with the possibility of describing the mind in mathematical terms, which can ultimately help design implementation tools and systems and therefore improve the quality of life of people. 

After dozens of iterations, I settled on a study plan: **5 workstreams** (Innovation/AI, Math, Neuroscience, Research+QI, Hands-on Projects) organized into **3 phases** by depth: Introductory → Foundational → In Depth.

Because this study plan evolved organically, I'm currently bridging Phases 2 and 3. The chronological order doesn't perfectly align before formalizing it. I aim to be fully in **Phase 3 by end of February** (tracked weekly). 

One of the things I have discovered is that I work better if I have a concrete plan in the short term, but more diffuse in the long term, allowing for changes that arise with experience.

As a disclaimer, I have built this github with the help of Perplexity AI - which has helped my ADHD brain materialize the structure in an efficient way.

## study plan overview

**3 phases** (introductory → foundational → in depth) across **6 workstreams**:

| phase | status | timeline | details |
|-------|--------|----------|---------|
| **1: introductory** | ✅ complete | -July 2024 | 20 certs, healthcare innovation + research and QI |
| **2: foundational** | 🟠 85% | Dec 2025-Jan 2026 | neuro + math foundations |
| **3: in depth** | 🟠 live | Jan-Aug 2026 | math + programming + neuroscience + hands-on projects |

**useful links**:  
[phd prep repo](https://github.com/melaniagr/phd-prep) is the structure I am working within   
[phd-prep README](https://github.com/melaniagr/phd-prep/blob/main/README.md) has a bit of an inside of my journey along with subsequent links to each phase, certifications, notes, etc   
[progress tracker](https://github.com/melaniagr/phd-prep/blob/main/progress-tracker.md) which I aim to update every week, even for my own sake     
[research and QI portfolio](https://github.com/melaniagr/research-and-QI-portfolio/tree/main) which mainly contains applied work and goes along some of the programmes I have attended
